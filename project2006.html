    <div class="grid-item1"> <h2>亗 Iᴛᴀᴄʜɪ Uᴄʜɪʜᴀ亗(うちは イタチ)</h2><br><br><br> The reason Itachi chose to kill his clan, because he knew that the Uchiha were not the only ones planning to attack, Danzo was also ready. Even if Itachi could have used the KOTOAMATSUKAMI on his father, there is no proof that the other members of the Uchiha Clan would have followed him. <br><br>

        Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha, and is responsible for killing all the elder members of their clan, sparing only Sasuke. He appears working as a terrorist from the organisation Akatsuki and serves as Sasuke's greatest enemy. <br><br>
        During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in attacks to ninjas possessing tailed-beast creatures (Jinchuriki) until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final duel, it is later revealed that Itachi had a secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha clan. Itachi is a playable character in most of the video games from the series. Itachi's character has been popular with readers of the manga[6] and has been positively received by critics. He is considered by many to be one of the best characters in the series. His appearance as an antagonist has been praised by several writers, although some have considered his initial appearance to be unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its impact on the story has also received positive reception,[7][8] and his fights were noted to be "one of the best" in the series.[9][10][11] Numerous types of merchandise have been released in Itachi's likeness, including keychains, plush dolls and figurines.

        <div class="grid-item001"> <h2>亗Obito Uchiha亗</h2> A child living through the Third Great Ninja War, Obito (Kakashi's teammate on Team Minato) wanted to become the Hokage of Konohagakure, and had an unrequited love for his teammate Rin. When he and Kakashi rescue the kidnapped Rin during a mission, Obito's right side is crushed in a landslide. Thinking he was going to die, Obito had Rin transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi to replace Kakashi's lost left eye.[13][14] Late in Part II of the manga, it is revealed that Obito was saved by an elderly Madara Uchiha and outfitted with prosthetics. He becomes Madara's apprentice, who has Obito witness Rin's death at the hands of a reluctant Kakashi to break his spirit. Concluding that he can use the Tailed Beasts to destroy the current reality and create a utopia, Obito adopts Madara's name and disguises his voice after the ninja's death; he then arranges similar events for Nagato with Yahiko's death to create the current incarnation of the Akatsuki.[15][16] While Kushina Uzumaki (then jinchuriki of Kurama, the Nine-Tails Kyuubi), is giving birth to Naruto Uzumaki, Obito mounts an attack on the Leaf Village, Konoha. He releases the seal over the Kyuubi from Kushina while she is weak during birth, and places the Nine-Tails under his control, releasing it on Konoha to tear the village apart and wreak havoc. During his infiltration, he encounters Minato Namikaze (the fourth Hokage) and they fight. Minato defeats Obito, and releases Kurama from Obito's control. Obito then flees, leaving Konoha to deal with the Nine-Tails, resulting in Minato and Kushina's deaths.[17][18] The character has a behind-the-scenes role in the first half of Part II</div>
        <div class="grid-item001">Adopting the identity of the spiral-patterned Zetsu which served as his bodysuit during his recuperation, Tobi, Obito poses as the carefree flunky and becomes Sasori's replacement and Deidara's partner early in Part II.[21] After Itachi's death, Obito takes a special interest in Sasuke Uchiha and takes him under his wing by revealing the truth about their clan's massacre.[22] He presents himself as Madara after Nagato's death, revealing the "Eye of the Moon" Plan to the Kage and explaining his intention to become the Ten-Tails Jinchuriki to bring all life within an Infinite Tsukuyomi. After the Kage refuses to surrender to him, Obito declares the Fourth Great Ninja War and forms a reluctant alliance with Kabuto Yakushi, who blackmails him with the real Madara's body.[23] Obito goes to retrieve Nagato Uzumaki's Rinnegan (輪廻眼, lit. "Saṃsāra Eye") from his body. In the process, he is opposed by Konan. Their argument, in which Konan affirms her faith in Naruto, and Obito (still impersonating Madara) claims his original ownership of the Rinnegan, quickly evolves into a fight. Konan attempts to catch him in various large-scale paper bomb detonations, but he manages to trick her with the Izanagi technique, and stabs her in the back; he obtains the location of Nagato's body through genjutsu, and proceeds to choke her to death. He retrieves Nagato's body and Rinnegan successfully.[24][25]

            Madara is a member of the Uchiha Clan, one of the strongest clans of the village of Konoha. During his childhood, he met a child named Hashirama and become his friend.[1] The two compete with each other to become strong. Together they envisioned a village where ninjas will not kill each other. After learning that Hashirama is a member of the Senju Clan (enemy of the Uchiha Clan), their friendship ends. After failing several attempts to defeat his rival, Madara accepts Hashirama's treaty offering of peace between the Uchiha and the Senju. They founded the village of Konoha. But their methods about peace differs. After his defection from the village, Madara challenged Hashirama again and a massive battle occured at the Valley of the End. Madara, believed to be killed in the battle, when into hiding for several years. While hiding, he planned to create a world of peace where there is no fighting and killing between ninjas.[2] He was already old when he activated the Rinnegan eyes. Because there's no time left, he transplanted his eyes to the young Nagato (to preserve the eyes for his later revival) and takes Obito Uchiha as his agent to accomplish his plan. He then entrusted Obito to use his name, Madara Uchiha.</div><br><br><br>

        <div class="grid-item001">Years later, Madara will be revided as a reanimated corpse by Kabuto Yakushi during the Fourth Great Ninja War. Madara manage sever his connection to Kabuto, killing most of the ninja forces. He then sacrificed Obito to become alive again. After obtaining one of his Rinnegan eyes and capturing all the tailed beasts, he became the Ten Tails host. After regaining his other eye, Madara is able to complete his plan (Infinite Tsukuyomi). He was later betrayed by Black Zetsu, who he believed to be his will. He then transformed into Princess Kaguya Ōtsutsuki (the progenitor of chakra). After the Naruto and Sasuke defeated both Kaguya and Black Zetsu, Madara was on the verge of death because of the Ten Tails and Demonic Statue extracted from his body. He spents his last time talking to the reincarnated Hashirama and finally makes peace with him as he dies.

            Biography: Kakashi graduated from the Ninja Academy and became a Genin, when he was merely 5 years old, then at 6 years old, became a Chuunin. He later became a Jounin and a member of the AnBu Assasination squad for Hidden Leaf Village. We see him as he takes up the role as being a sensei for the new Chunnins. Kakashi values team work very much and believes in a battle, your first responbility is to guarantee the safety of your companions. Oh, and he has a Sharingan eye which can copy any ninja skills he sees, but since the Sharingan pupil are usually in both eyes, it's rumoured that Kakashi's sharingan was put into him through surgery.
